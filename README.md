#ASSIGNMENT

Q8 team is asking your consultancy company to advise them on their customer behavior. They want you to take the lead on a project they recently started:

The Q8 Loyal Customer Challenge

In particular, they want you to dig into their customer datasets (personal, geographic and transactional datasets) to study and understand if there are predominant/characteristic behaviors of club Q8 loyal customers in order to guide business decision.

You have around 2.5 months to come back with a report.

Be creative, play with the data, find information wherever you can and show what you’ve got!


#INSTRUCTIONS

Consideration of business and market reality 
Take into account facts about Q8 business. Make sure you read well annual reports, website, and all kind of documentation about Q8 before starting the project. 
Go outside the database you were provided. E.g. consider the competitive environment of Q8, consider Italian cultural environment and gather any type of data that can be helpful to your analysis (e.g. demographic data, comparison with similar businesses in other regions or competitors, etc.)
Anchor business recommendations into Business reality. A recommendation needs to be efficient (i.e. achieving maximum return with minimum wasted effort or expense); in other words, not only your recommendations should be feasible (taking into account business reality) but it should also represent the best allocation of Q8 effort and expenses.
Creativity
Obvious recommendations have been already analyzed by Q8 (and will not provide added value to them) so think outside the box. 
Find the right balance between creativity and pragmatism. We are aware it is a difficult challenge, but this is also why you are hired to solve such challenge.
Robust data analysis 
Make sure your data tells the true story because statistics can lead to any conclusions. 
Cross-check your conclusions with different models (if another model tells a completely different story than your main model, it means you have to dig further into your data to find out what is the right conclusion). 
Make sure your results are significant (e.g. if you make regressions, check your P-value, R², etc.). 
Correlations between variables could be tricky, adding a variable to a model can change your results, you must spend some time playing with the data before finding the right conclusions.
Always find the right balance between complexity, accuracy, simplicity, and interpretability. 
Complex models may make you look like a genius but in the end, it may not lead to concrete recommendations.
Accurate models are usually black boxes and could also lead to overfitting issues.
On the other side, simple models could lead to the wrong conclusions.



#MIDTERM REPORT INSTRUCTIONS

For your mid-term, we expect you to prepare with your team a report about your progress. This report is mandatory but will not count for your final grade. 

Quick points

Unlimited appendices

Additional information that do not fit the 8-pages report

With your codes and description of your codes 

Deadline: 7 December (12am, Brussels time)



Your report should include the following points (The sub-points aim to help you, no need to follow it step by step).

Team name and team composition (with info on the members of the team)

The theoretical/business side: Did other analysts investigate the same (kind of) question before you? What were their conclusion?  What is the methodology of previous/similar studies? Can you use the same (kind of) methodology? Which information can you find about Q8 that is related to your question(s) (on their website, annual report,interviews, press, etc.) 
A first data exploration: How did you clean your data? Could you find additional data to enrich your database/study? Descriptive statistics Which trends (related to your question(s)) can you observe from your first data exploration? 
A description of the methodology: Which models/techniques/algorithms do you use (or plan to use) to efficiently answer your question? Are your models/techniques/algorithms robust enough to draw conclusions? 
Preliminary results: What are the first conclusions of the above data analysis? Are your conclusions aligned with market/business reality and previous studies?  Based on your preliminary results, which recommendations could you make to Q8 managers?
Next steps: What are your plans to have a better analysis (more robust model etc.)? What are your plans to effectively communicate your study to an audience from various backgrounds? Which channel will you use (regular PowerPoint? Regular report? Interactive PowerPoint? Video? Interactive report? ...) ?
